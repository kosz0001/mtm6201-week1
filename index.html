                <p>Hello! My name is Amanda Koszarycz, and I am a current student at Algonquin College. My hobbies include perusing the thrift stores in order to collect CD's to grow my collection, and watching true crime documentaries on Netflix. I also play the violin, I started when I was 6 years old, but I have been out of practice the last few years. I like various types of food, however I cannot consider myself a foodie because I am a picky eater. I specifically do not like olives or onions. I also really love travelling, although I do not think I'll be taking a trip anytime soon, sadly.
